# Start ...

Seems this is the starting point of my journey.  
My Rust journey!  

The final goal is to create a raytracer in Rust, in order to learn this programmation language.  
As a first step, I will read, and write some notes on the [official Rust book][1].

Note that I have already multiple lives, so don't except to have some update every day. I hope to be able to update every few weeks :)  

Cheers
